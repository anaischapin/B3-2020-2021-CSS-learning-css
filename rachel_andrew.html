	<h1>Rachel Andrew</h1>

<div class="contents">
	<h2>Autobiography</h2>

		<p>I am Editor in Chief of Smashing Magazine, a Member of The CSS Working Group, and the W3C representative for Fronteers. I am Managing Director and founder of web development company edgeofmyseat.com. Founded in 2001 as a web development consultancy, the company moved into products launching Perch CMS in 2009 and Notist in 2018.</p>
		<p>My professional web development skills range from front and back-end development to operations. I am also an experienced writer and editor focusing on technical and business writing.</p>

	<h2>Writing and editing</h2>

		<p>Since 2001 I have authored or co-authored a number of books and many articles for on and offline publications. I love writing about the things I am interested in, and sharing what I learn. I am an experienced developmental and technical editor, and have edited several books and countless articles.</p>

	<h2>Speaking</h2>

		<p>I am an experienced conference speaker, able to deliver a technical talk to teach your audience about CSS Layout or a keynote to inspire them. You can see where I am next, and also find my archive of talks and video on my Notist Profile.</p>
		<p>If you would like me to speak at your event please read this first and then drop me a line. Given the current situation I am very happy to present at online events!</p>

	<h2>Personal life</h2>

		<p>In my personal life I have a grown-up daughter, and a cat called Pixel.</p>
		<p>When I am not writing code, writing about writing code or on a plane to speak to some people about code I have a range of interests. I’m currently learning to fly small aeroplanes, working towards my PPL. I run a lot, sometimes cycle and swim, am always happy for company if fellow runners at conferences want to join me to explore the sites on foot!</p>
		<p>My interests include family history and religious studies. The former has led me to discover that I am descended from Irish Travellers and the latter gained me a First Class degree in Humanities with Religious Studies from the Open University.</p>
		<p>I’m an ex-dancer and singer, ex-West End Theatre Technician and a pretty decent stage manager. I take photographs; can dress-make, cook, read Latin and lift heavy stuff, although not all at once.</p>
